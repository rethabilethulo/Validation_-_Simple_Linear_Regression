# Validation_-_Simple_Linear_Regression

## Contents :


### Question 1 :

•Importing And Exploring Data Analysis.

•Examining missing values

•Visualising and interpretring distributions

•Splitting data into training and testing

•Examining extreme values


### Question 2 :

•Running A Simple Linear Regression to the Training

•Finding the report the amount of variance explained (R^2) and significance value (p)

•Percentage of the variance


### Question 3 :

•The unstandardized coefficient (B or ‘coef’ in statsmodels)


### Question 4 :

•The 95% confidence intervals [0.025, 0.975]

### Question 5 :

•The expected salary for someone with 12 years’ work experience

### Question 6 :

•The expected salary for someone with years’ work experience

### Question 7 :

•Other employee characteristics might influence salary


### Comparing model when running it on the test set 

•Root Mean Square Error

### Conclusion :

I can conclude that the model is overfitted.The test root mean square error is more than the training root mean square error.This means that the model is not fitted for testing dataset.To avoid overfitting I should draw a random sample instead of modelling with a contant  that is large enough to handle all of the terms that I expect to include in my model.
